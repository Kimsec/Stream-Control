## Manage Streaming Destinations

Stream Control makes it easy to stream to multiple platforms simultaneously.

### How to Add a Streaming Destination:

1. Go to the **Restream Tab**
2. Click **Edit Endpoints**
3. In the popup window:
   - **Name**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "YouTube", "Facebook")
   - **URL**: Paste the RTMP URL from the platform
   - **Checkbox**: Check to enable the destination
4. Click **Save**

The system will automatically:
- Update the configuration
- Start streaming to the new destinations
- Show green status icon when everything is working

### Enable and Disable Destinations

You can at any time:
- Uncheck to stop streaming to a destination
- Check again to re-enable it
- Delete destinations you no longer need

---

## Chat Commands

You can control your stream directly from Twitch chat. Only users listed in `TWITCH_ADMINS` can use these commands.

**Important:** Commands must be typed EXACTLY as shown (lowercase).

| Command | What does it do? |
|---------|------------------|
| `!start` | Starts the stream and goes to starting scene |
| `!live` | Switches to live scene |
| `!brb` | Switches to "Be Right Back" scene |
| `!fix` | Switches to BRB and back to Live (to fix small issues) |
| `!stop` | Stops the stream |

### Example:
If you type `!brb` in chat, the stream will automatically switch to your BRB scene.

---

## Automatic Features

Stream Guard continuously monitors your stream and makes adjustments automatically.

### ðŸ“‰ Automatic Scene Switching During Poor Internet

**How it works:**
1. Stream Guard continuously checks your internet connection
2. If bitrate (speed) falls below the threshold you set, this happens:
   - Stream automatically switches to "low bitrate" scene
   - You receive an alert (audio and visual)
3. When internet is stable again:
   - Stream automatically returns to live scene
   - You're notified that the connection is back

**Settings you can adjust:**
- `BITRATE_LOW_KBPS`: How low bitrate before switching scene
- `BITRATE_HIGH_KBPS`: How high bitrate must be before switching back
- `LOW_CONSEC_SAMPLES`: How many consecutive poor measurements before switching

### ðŸŽ¯ Automatic Stop After Raid

If enabled, the stream will automatically stop shortly after you raid another streamer.

**To enable:**
Set `RAID_AUTO_STOP_ENABLED=true` in the `.env` file.

**Delay:**
Set `RAID_AUTO_STOP_DELAY` (in seconds) for how long to wait before stopping.

---

## Audio Alerts

Stream Control can notify you with sound when important events occur.

### What do you get alerts for?
- ðŸ”´ **Low bitrate**: When internet connection degrades
- ðŸŸ¢ **Connection restored**: When internet is back to normal

### How does it work?
Alerts use text-to-speech (TTS) to speak messages aloud on your website. This allows you to hear alerts even if you're not looking at the screen.

---

## Log Viewer

You can view logs from all your services directly in the control panel.

### How to Open Log Viewer:
1. Go to the **Mini-PC Tab**
2. Click the **Logs** button

### What can you do?
- **Select service**: View logs from StreamGuard, nginx, stunnel, etc.
- **Select number of lines**: Show the last 25, 50, or 100 lines
- **Follow live**: Enable to see new log messages in real-time
- **Color codes**: Errors shown in red, warnings in yellow, etc.

This makes it easy to find out what's happening if something goes wrong, without using complex commands.

---

## Status Indicators

At the top of the control panel, you'll see small dots showing the status of all services:

### What do the colors mean?

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ðŸŸ¢ Green | Everything is working as it should |
| âšª Gray | Service is not active or disconnected |
| ðŸ”´ Red | There's a problem that needs fixing |

### What is monitored?

| Service | What it is |
|---------|-----------|
| **Chatbot** | Your chat bot (if you have one) |
| **Nginx** | Server that sends stream to multiple places |
| **Stunnel** | Secure streaming connection |
| **StreamGuard** | Background program monitoring your stream |
| **ChatGuard** | Chat monitoring and commands |
| **SLS** | Streaming server status |
| **OBS** | Whether OBS is connected |
| **Twitch Events** | Whether Twitch events work (raid, chat) |
| **Raid AutoStop** | Whether automatic raid stop is active |
| **Twitch Token** | Whether Twitch connection is valid |

The dots update automatically, so you always see current status.

## Security Tips

Stream Control gives you control over a lot, so it's important to secure it properly:

### âœ… Recommended Security Measures

1. **Use Strong Passwords**
   - Choose a long and complex password for `LOGIN_PASSWORD`
   - Generate a long, random string for `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`

2. **Protect Access**
   - Use VPN or limit to local network
   - If opening to internet: set up a reverse proxy with HTTPS

3. **Protect Token File**
   - Set correct file permissions on `twitch_tokens.json` (only owner can read/write)
   - Command: `chmod 600 twitch_tokens.json`

4. **Don't Share Secrets**
   - Never share the `.env` file with others
   - Don't commit `.env` to Git
   - Never share stream keys publicly

5. **Keep System Updated**
   - Update Stream Control regularly
   - Keep Python and other dependencies updated

6. **Minimize Access**
   - Only grant necessary sudo permissions
   - Limit which commands can be run via control panel

---

## IP Banning

Stream Control has built-in support for blocking unwanted IP addresses.

### How it works:
- Connections from blocked IP addresses are stopped immediately
- Blocked attempts are logged
- You can manage blocks via the `/bans` page

### Manage Blocked IP Addresses:
1. Go to `/bans` in your browser (e.g., http://localhost:5000/bans)
2. Here you can:
   - View list of blocked IP addresses
   - Add new IP addresses to block
   - Unblock IP addresses

### Important:
- Be careful not to block yourself
- Protect the `bans.json` file from unauthorized access
- Blocked IP addresses are stored in `bans.json`

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: OBS shows "Error" in status

**Possible causes:**
- OBS is not running
- obs-websocket is not installed
- Wrong port or password

**Solution:**
1. Check that OBS is running
2. Verify that obs-websocket plugin is installed (version 5)
3. Double-check `OBS_PORT` and `OBS_PASSWORD` in `.env`

---

### Problem: Twitch token remains invalid

**Possible causes:**
- Refresh token has expired
- Error in token file

**Solution:**
1. Generate new tokens via Twitch API
2. Update both `TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN` and `TWITCH_REFRESH_TOKEN` in `.env`
3. Restart both services

---

### Problem: Raid doesn't stop stream

**Possible causes:**
- `RAID_AUTO_STOP_ENABLED` is not set to `true`
- Twitch connection is not working

**Solution:**
1. Check that status indicators "Twitch Events WS" and "Raid AutoStop" are green
2. Verify that `RAID_AUTO_STOP_ENABLED=true` in `.env`
3. Check StreamGuard logs for more information

---

### Problem: Automatic scene switching doesn't work

**Possible causes:**
- `STATS_URL` is wrong or unavailable
- Bitrate thresholds are set incorrectly

**Solution:**
1. Test `STATS_URL` in browser - should return JSON data
2. Check that `BITRATE_LOW_KBPS` and `BITRATE_HIGH_KBPS` are reasonable values
3. Check StreamGuard logs for bitrate measurements

---

### Problem: Nginx doesn't reload after restream changes

**Possible causes:**
- Syntax error in endpoint URL
- nginx doesn't have permission to reload

**Solution:**
1. Double-check that all RTMP URLs are correct
2. Check nginx logs for error messages
3. Verify that user has sudo access to `nginx -s reload`

---

### Problem: Chat commands don't work

**Possible causes:**
- Username is not in `TWITCH_ADMINS`
- Command is typed incorrectly (must be lowercase)
- Chat connection is down

**Solution:**
1. Check that username is listed in `TWITCH_ADMINS` (lowercase, no @)
2. Type command exactly as shown: `!start`, `!live`, `!brb`, `!fix`, `!stop`
3. Verify that "ChatGuard" is green in status indicator

---

### Problem: Can't see Twitch player or chat

**Possible causes:**
- Wrong domain name in embed settings
- Blocked by ad blocker
- Twitch API issue

**Solution:**
1. Check that your domain name is correctly configured
2. Try disabling ad blocker temporarily
3. Check if you can open Twitch directly in browser

---

### General tips:
- **Always check logs first** - They often show what's wrong
- **Restart both services** - Many problems are solved with a restart
- **Double-check `.env` file** - Many errors come from incorrect configuration
- **Test step by step** - Start with basic functionality before adding more
